My take on the Cool Shuffling Effect in Pure CSS as created by Toni Lijic @tonilijic
https://www.toni.li/about

Chris Coyer @chriscoyier  and Jason Lengstorf  @jlengstorf demonstrated how they would approach this on a live stream (which I missed). 
Before watching their stream or looking at any source code I wanted to have a go myself.

This is a pure CSS version. Not overly practical but still fun to do.
Still a but buggy regarding the ordering when going backwards and dubious as regards accesibility
